This is still very nacent, and not functional as of yet.

Initial support will only be for the d2vzw (SCH-I535)

I'm really not taking credit for any of this, I'm just trying to make it easy to backup my S3 to my laptop
so I can save space on my external and internal sdcards cause stock touchwiz is HUGE!
